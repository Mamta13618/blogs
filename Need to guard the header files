In C++ the header files are guarded with the MACROS #ifndef .
One .h file can be included in multiple .cpp files and in this case compiler gives the following error
error: redefinition of ‘class engine’ // Whatever we have defined<class, variable , functions etc> in the header file when included again and will give the redefinition error
To avoid this -
#ifndef __ENGINE_H
#define __ENGINE_H
class engine
{
    //CODE
};
#endif
It defines engine only once when its not defined .
